# Projects from Data100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science

## Project 1: Analyzing Trump's Tweets
A fun and relevant project where we analyzed various trends in Trump's tweeting habits.
- Scraped tweets from Twitter's Official API.
- Analyzed the devices used for Trump's tweets.
- Used the words in Trump's tweets to calculate and analyze the sentiment of the tweet.
- Observed the trends in Trump's most retweeted tweets.

## Project 2: Ham or Spam?
We created a classifier that distinguishes spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) email.
- Feature Engineering: Created a numeric feature matrix for logistic regression.
- EDA: Identified some features that allowed us to tell spam and ham emails apart.
- Classification: Trained a classifier to distinguish between these two types of emails using _scikit-learn_.
- Created a precision-recall curve.
